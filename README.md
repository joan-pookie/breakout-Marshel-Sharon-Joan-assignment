problem 1 ; Finding the capitals 
    instructions ;
        Complete the method that takes a sequence of objects with two keys each: country or state, and capital. Keys may be symbols or strings.

The method should return an array of sentences declaring the state or country and its capital.

Examples
[{'state': 'Maine', 'capital': 'Augusta'}] --> ["The capital of Maine is Augusta"]
[{'country' : 'Spain', 'capital' : 'Madrid'}] --> ["The capital of Spain is Madrid"]
[{"state" : 'Maine', 'capital': 'Augusta'}, {'country': 'Spain', "capital" : "Madrid"}] --> ["The capital of Maine is Augusta", "The capital of Spain is Madrid"]


 
problem 2 ; Grasshopper personalized message

Create a function that gives a personalized greeting. This function takes two parameters: name and owner.

Use conditionals to return the proper message:

case	return
name equals owner	'Hello boss'
otherwise	'Hello guest'



Problem 3 ; A needle in the Haystack

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

Example(Input --> Output)

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] -->
